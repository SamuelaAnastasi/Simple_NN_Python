# Simple_NN_Python
The project builds 2 simple Neural Networks from scratch in Python without use of any Framework.   
The first NN has 3 inputs and 1 output neurons It will try to predict the binay digit 0 or 1 given a small database of 4 training examples containing 0 and 1.  
The second NN contains 1 input + 1 hidden + output layer. It predicts results based on the combination of 2 inputs simulating the XOR Gate.
